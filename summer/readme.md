Got sidetracked trying to understand how RNNs work at their base, and how the backpropagation
(did not successfully understand this)

## Ideas developed
None
## Concerns or risks identified
I have too little understanding of how progress is made in neural network research to come up with any innovative or creative ideas myself
I don't understand neural networks
I haven't read the papers that are relevant
I am very behind
